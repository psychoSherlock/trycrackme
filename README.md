# TryCrackMe Solutions
This repo contains solutions for the [TryCrackMe](https://trycrack.me) challanges that I was able to solve.
Note: Please only refer to the solutions if you have given up. It is okay to learn when you are given up, but make sure you have tried your level best. Dont always rely on writeups. I dont want to ruin your TryCrackMe experience.

Also there are multiple ways to solve a challange and I am very sure mine wont be the best way. Its just one of the way.
